This repo gives files and instructions for setting the foot terminal up
in my own preferences matching themes from my nvim config.

simply place the foot.init file where necessary for foot to read, this is
typically matthew/.config/foot/foot.init but the location can be selected
manually if not.

you will also need to install the menlo font into your system included in this
repo

Lastly I have forced the titlebar theme as 'Krita dark orange' to match the 
color scheme in kde. you can do this by right clicking the titlebar and going
'moor actions' -> 'configure special application settings'
